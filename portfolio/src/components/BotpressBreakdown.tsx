          While usuable, the current design suffered a few noticable bottlenecks
          when creating bots. My role was to work with the engineers to design
          and create a proper node editing experience and to expand our new UX
          vision from to the rest of the editor. I worked on a team of 3 other
          engineers as the sole designer. I conducted user research to inform my
          design decisions. Then, worked with the rest of the team to prototype
          various solutions that we could implement quickly all without making
          major changes to the backend. Finally created high fidelity mockups
          and applied our cohesive style to the rest of the application as well
          as mocked up future product features.

        <div className="text-base">
          I was approached by an engineer at Botpress to assist with their node
          editor UI problem. The current method of editing nodes was causing a
          lot of frustration from users do to endless time in pop-up modals.
          Important information pertaining to the modal was blocked by the
          layered overlays. Their initial approach was to consolidate all the
          modals into one. An editor UI would overlay the workflow screen and
          the use could leave at any time by clicking outside the edited node.
          This solution added the ability to drag the content blocks inside the
          editor node. The inspector would provide the ui to edit the nodeâ€™s
          properties.

          I wireframed the exprience while discussing it Nick Boutboul, the
          engineer. Along the way we had some realizations. First, editing
          content could contained to the inspector. Second, editing should be
          contained to the right half of the screen, and third we could achieve
          the same results without a pop up overlay. After wireframing we set 3
          inital goals to direct our thinking. Reduce flickering and use modals
          throughout the experience Keep a clear and consistant style Intuitive
          enough for a designer and powerful enough for an engineer

            There are many examples of inconsistency throughout the studio as

          In order to make better use of space I moved the emulator under the
          inspector. When the panels were next to each other you'd have a lot of
          unused space. For a majority of the time the pertinent information
          while testing a bot is only within the past 2-3 messages.

          This UI project taught me a lot about how to manage and design more
          complex systems and features. The small time frame reinforced the
          practice of rapid iteration then editing down to the best solution. It
          gave me lots of practice simplifying experiences down to their core
          purpose.
